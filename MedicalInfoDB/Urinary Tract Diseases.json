  "Nocturnal Enuresis": {
    "Symptoms": [
      "1. *Involuntary Urination:* The primary symptom is the unintentional release of urine during sleep. Children may wet the bed once or more per week.",
      "2. *Age Consideration:* Nocturnal enuresis is generally considered a normal part of development up to a certain age. Most children achieve nighttime bladder control between the ages of 3 and 5. Bedwetting becomes more concerning if it persists beyond the age when most children have mastered this skill.",
      "3. *Frequency:* Enuresis is often considered a problem if it occurs at least twice a week for three consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years old.",
      "4. *Daytime Continence:* Children with nocturnal enuresis usually have no issues with daytime bladder control. Daytime wetting can indicate a different problem and should be evaluated separately.",
      "5. *Emotional Impact:* Bedwetting can have psychological and emotional effects on children, leading to feelings of embarrassment, shame, or frustration. It's essential for parents to offer support and understanding.",
      "6. *Physical Examinations:* In some cases, healthcare providers may conduct physical examinations to rule out underlying medical conditions contributing to bedwetting. This could include checking for urinary tract infections or structural abnormalities.",
      "7. *Family History:* There may be a genetic component to nocturnal enuresis. If one or both parents experienced bedwetting as children, their offspring may be more likely to as well. It's important to note that bedwetting is often a self-limiting condition, and many children outgrow it without specific intervention. However, if parents are concerned about their child's bedwetting, or if it persists beyond what is considered normal for their age, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional. They can help determine if there are underlying issues and discuss potential treatment options, which may include behavioral strategies, medications, or other interventions based on the specific circumstances."
