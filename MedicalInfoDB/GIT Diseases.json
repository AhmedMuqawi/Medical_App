    "Symptoms": [
      "1. Diarrhea: Loose, watery stools are a common symptom. It's important to monitor the frequency and consistency.",
      "2. Vomiting: Children with gastroenteritis often experience vomiting, which can lead to dehydration.",
      "3. Abdominal Pain: Cramps and discomfort in the stomach area are common. Children may express this as general tummy ache.",
      "4. Nausea: Feeling sick to the stomach is another common symptom.",
      "5. Fever: Some children may develop a fever along with gastroenteritis.",
      "6. Dehydration: Watch for signs like dry mouth, sunken eyes, reduced urine output, or lethargy. Dehydration is a significant concern, especially in young children.",
      "7. Loss of Appetite: Children may not feel like eating or drinking due to the discomfort in their stomach."
    ],
    "Red Flags": [
      "1. Severe Dehydration: Watch for signs such as sunken eyes, dry mouth and tongue, no tears when crying, lethargy, or extreme fussiness.",
      "2. High Fever: A persistent high fever (above 102°F or 38.9°C) that doesn't respond to fever-reducing medication may indicate a more serious infection.",
      "3. Blood in Stool or Vomit: If you observe blood in your child's stool or vomit, it's a significant concern and requires immediate medical attention.",
      "4. Inability to Keep Fluids Down: If your child is unable to tolerate any fluids and continues to vomit excessively, this can lead to dehydration and may require medical intervention.",
      "5. Signs of Severe Abdominal Pain: If your child experiences intense abdominal pain that doesn't improve with rest or over-the-counter medications, it could be a sign of a more serious issue. Always trust your instincts as a parent. If you're ever unsure or concerned about your child's health, don't hesitate to contact a healthcare professional or seek emergency medical attention."
    ],
    "Initial management": [
      "1. Hydration: Encourage the child to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) containing electrolytes and fluids are recommended. Small, frequent sips are often better tolerated than large amounts at once.",
      "2. Breastfeeding or Formula Feeding: For infants, continue breastfeeding or formula feeding. If the child is having difficulty keeping fluids down, smaller, more frequent feedings may be helpful.",
      "3. Avoid Certain Beverages: Avoid giving sugary drinks, caffeinated beverages, and dairy products, as they can worsen diarrhea.",
      "4. Monitor for Signs of Dehydration: Keep an eye on signs such as decreased urine output, dry mouth, lethargy, or sunken eyes. Seek medical attention if dehydration is suspected.",
      "5. Nutrition: Gradually reintroduce a normal diet as tolerated. Start with easily digestible foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet).",
      "6. Probiotics: Some studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce the duration and severity of gastroenteritis. Consult with a healthcare professional before giving probiotics to a child.",
