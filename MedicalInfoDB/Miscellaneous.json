  "Urticaria": {
    "Symptoms": [
      "1. Raised Welts (Wheals): The primary symptom of urticaria is the presence of raised, red or pink welts on the skin. These welts can be small or large and are often surrounded by an area of redness.",
      "2. Itching: Urticaria is typically accompanied by intense itching. Children may complain of itching or discomfort associated with the welts.",
      "3. Variable Appearance: The welts associated with urticaria can change shape and move around the body. New welts may appear while others fade away. The rash can be dynamic and change rapidly.",
      "4. Red or White Center: The center of each welt may appear red or white, giving it a distinct appearance. This is sometimes referred to as a 'wheal and flare' reaction.",
      "5. Swelling: In addition to redness and itching, some children may experience swelling of the affected areas. Swelling can be mild to severe, depending on the individual's reaction.",
      "6. Facial Swelling: In some cases, urticaria can cause swelling of the face, lips, and eyes, leading to a puffy appearance.",
      "7. Angioedema: In more severe cases, children may experience angioedema, which involves swelling deeper in the skin layers. This can occur around the eyes, lips, hands, feet, or genitalia.",
      "8. Symptoms of an Underlying Condition: Urticaria can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or allergy. If the welts are accompanied by other symptoms like difficulty breathing, wheezing, or abdominal pain, it's important to seek medical attention promptly."
    ],
    "Red Flags": [
      "1. Difficulty Breathing: If a child is experiencing difficulty breathing, wheezing, or shortness of breath along with urticaria, it could indicate a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. This is a medical emergency, and immediate intervention, including the use of an epinephrine auto-injector (if available), is crucial.",
      "2. Swelling of the Face, Lips, or Tongue: Severe swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, known as angioedema, can be associated with urticaria. If this swelling is significant and affecting the child's ability to breathe or swallow, seek emergency medical help.",
      "3. Rapid Spread of Hives: If the hives are spreading rapidly and covering large areas of the body, it may indicate a more severe allergic or systemic reaction. This could be a sign of a serious underlying condition and requires prompt medical assessment.",
      "4. Persistent Vomiting or Diarrhea: If urticaria is accompanied by persistent vomiting or diarrhea, it may suggest a more systemic reaction that requires medical evaluation.",
      "5. Change in Consciousness or Alertness: Any alteration in consciousness, such as drowsiness, confusion, or loss of consciousness, is a critical red flag. This may indicate a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, and immediate medical attention is needed.",
      "6. Bluish Discoloration of the Lips or Skin: Bluish discoloration, especially around the lips or in the extremities, can be a sign of inadequate oxygenation and requires immediate medical intervention.",
      "7. History of Severe Allergic Reactions: If the child has a known history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, any appearance of urticaria should be taken seriously, as it may be a part of a systemic allergic response.",
      "8. Unresponsiveness to Antihistamines: If the child has taken antihistamines, which are commonly used to treat urticaria, and there is no improvement or the symptoms worsen, it's important to seek medical advice."
